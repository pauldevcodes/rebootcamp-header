# TheRebootCamp - Frontend Web App

The Reboot Camp is the annual camp meeting of Celebration Church International (CCI).

This platform is to be an all-in-one application that would allow CCI coordinate and manage TRC every year and allow members and other users register for the program.

It should be designed with CCI branding and infused with TRC branding and themes.
